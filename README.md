# selfmade-wall-CAM-HOLDERS-mounting-autodarts (pictures at the end of this text!)

selfmade wall mounting for autodarts with metall shelf holder from the hardware store
Purchasing and procurement of material for camera mounts:

3x black shelf brackets 300mm long (see link as follows)
cable ties
m5 locksmith screw 3-4cm long
3x wing screw M5 (easier assembly with readjustment)
6x washer M5

Dowels and fastening material are included with the shelf brackets (we only need 3 brackets, 1x is a reserve).

The shelf brackets are now screwed to the wall at the height of the dartboard 16/7 12/5 and on the 6 with the shorter leg side (2 holes). Other assembly constellations are also possible, I will not go into more detail on this (e.g. 1/18 / 11 / 17/2). The edge of the dartboard forms the optimal reference point so that the standard surround can be used precisely. It is best to mount the brackets when the dartboard is already mounted on the wall, place the surround over the board and then slide the brackets in the corresponding number range behind the surround as far as they will go. So you have the perfect distance right away. Watch picture at the end of this description!

Then the (in my case TARGET CORONA LED) LIGHT RING with the magnets is placed back on the Board.  This mounting method has the advantage that the cams are later installed completely vibration-free and decoupled from the disc or light ring.  NO VIBRATIONS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT!
The wing screws  having the possibility changing the camera mounting at any time  
  
The separate mounting of the 45 ° angle will be done later on the cameras as little as possible directly in terms of rotation (high / low) to adjust. The danger always exists due to the 360° options with many  webcams that they will be touched unintentionally by an arrow bounce when pulling out the arrows.  
Therefore, a "STRAIGHT" mounting is advantageous and it should be tried to leave the cams in the "original form" and  the "original shape".  

On the pictures you can see various mounting methods. Once the angle was mounted on the  
INSIDE and again another time on the OUTSIDE of the Holder. This depends later also  
on the respective camera type and there you have to try a little bit what is the better option for you.  
Another picture shows a rectangular angle (had in the hardware store no 45 ° get). This I have made with a locksmith's hammer with a few hammer punches building it to 45 °. As I said, whether this is necessary or not depends on the camera itself and the adjustment possibilities. You should try to get ready 45° angle. Most of Autodarts-Users think thats the best angle.

I would recommend these (6 pieces 15€ possibly cheaper directly in the hardware store but you need only 3 pieces  and its cheaper to do it by yourself.
Just buy rectangular since under 1 € and "hammer" it by yourself.   

Now you screw that with the wing screws and washers to the shelf angle (this already has a prefabricated hole, which you can also see in the previous Amazon picture).  


Inside - or outside mounting as you like or how it fits best with the cameras!  


Optimally the angle looks then with approx. 45° inclination in the direction of the bullseye.  
Can you also measure out with a folding rule now the 45°. You should now be somewhere between 42- and 45 degrees  
if you have done everything correctly.  Measure from the bullseye CENTER to the angle outside approx. 43-44cm.   
The adjustment angle offers the possibility to adjust the distance by 5cm +/- out at any time (later for calibration of the software a good approach).  
After that you mount the cameras. Advantage is who has cams that have a UNF photo female thread (1/4" inch), these you can attach with ¼ photo screws (google) then. For the first tests do it also two fixed
Cable ties (important is, the camera must be tight). There must be nothing wobbly about the construction! The  
Fine adjustment is later only marginally via the swivel joints of the cam.  

Now you mount all 3 cameras and lay the cables neatly along the holders (shelf brackets) with  
cable ties. The shelf holder has another hole further back. Here again a small cable tie can be threaded through and the CAM cable can be routed along the underside. Attention! In the arm area where the cam is mounted, leave about 10cm of cable a little looser. You need that "play" of the cable in case  
later still something must be turned.    


Tip and Hint! The complete cable routing can be solved wonderfully via the self-adhesive cable tie holders. Who wants to have it clean, works with it. It is  
matter of taste how someone lays his cables. No further instructions are given here.   


Goal should be that finally the 3 USB CABLES run together at the right ARM HOLDER (with me on the "6"). The Raspberry will be attached to this one later.   

Handwork is Done!
